# Geolocation-Data-Clustering

## Geolocation Data Clustering  in Python
We have taxi rank locations, and want to define key clusters of these taxis where we can build service stations for all taxis operating in that region.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Matplotlib skills for plotting 2-D data clearly.
- Basic understanding of Pandas and how to use it for data manipulation.
- The concepts behind clustering algorithms.

## Project Outline

**Task 1** : Exploratory Data Analysis

**Task 2** : Visualizing Geographical Data

**Task 3** : Clustering Strength / Performance Metric

**Task 4** : K-Means Clustering

**Task 5** : DBSCAN
